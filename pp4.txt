Great idea! Here's a plan to create a Reddit-style news site using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Django, and MySQL:

Design the website's user interface with HTML and CSS. Create a homepage that lists the latest news stories and a navigation bar with links to different categories.

Use JavaScript to create a form for users to submit news stories. The form should include fields for the title, category, and description. Users should be able to upload images or videos to accompany their stories.

Use Django to create a backend for the site. Create models for news stories, comments, and user profiles. Use Django's authentication system to allow users to sign up, log in, and log out.

Use MySQL to store data for the site. Use Django's ORM to create tables for news stories, comments, and user profiles. Set up relationships between the tables, such as a one-to-many relationship between news stories and comments.

Use JavaScript to create a voting system for news stories. Allow users to upvote or downvote stories, and display the total number of votes for each story.

Use JavaScript to create a commenting system for news stories. Allow users to leave comments on stories, and display the comments below the story.

Use Django to create a search function for the site. Allow users to search for news stories by keyword, category, or date.

Use Django to create a page for each news story. Display the story's title, category, description, images or videos, and the total number of upvotes and comments. Allow users to edit or delete their own stories and comments.
